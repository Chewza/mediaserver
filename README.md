# Docker Plex & Usenet Media Server #

docker-based plex & usenet media server using custom subdomains with tls

## Motivation

* host services at `<service>.<yourdomain>.com` over https
* run public maintained images with no modifications
* keep source repo small (2 required files)
* require minimal configuration and setup

## Features

* [Plex](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex/) organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone Plex Media Server.
* [NZBGet](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/nzbget/) is a usenet downloader, written in C++ and designed with performance in mind to achieve maximum download speed by using very little system resources.
* [Sonarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/sonarr/) (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
* [Radarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/radarr/) - A fork of Sonarr to work with movies Ã  la Couchpotato.
* [NZBHydra](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/hydra2/) 2 is a meta search application for NZB indexers, the "spiritual successor" to NZBmegasearcH, and an evolution of the original application NZBHydra . It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers.
* [Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.

## Requirements

* dedicated server or PC with plenty of storage
* windows or linux x86/x64 os (not ARM)
* custom top-level domain with configurable sub-domains (eg. plex.mydomain.com)
* [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) dns for automatic tls

## Pre-Install

1. login to [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and select your domain
2. select `Full (strict)` under `Crypto` -> `SSL`
3. add dns records for each service under `DNS` -> `DNS Records`

|Type|Name|Value|
|---|---|---|
|`A`|`plex.yourdomain.com`|`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`|
|`A`|`hydra.yourdomain.com`|`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`|
|`A`|`sonarr.yourdomain.com`|`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`|
|`A`|`radarr.yourdomain.com`|`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`|
|`A`|`nzbget.yourdomain.com`|`xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`|

## Install

```bash
# 1. install docker
# https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/
curl -sSL get.docker.com | sh

# 2. install docker-compose
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose
sudo curl -L --fail https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/run.sh -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# 3. clone mediaserver repo
git clone https://github.com/klutchell/mediaserver.git
```

## Configure

1. `traefik.frontend.rule` needs to be set for each service in `docker-compose.yml`
2. `CF_API_EMAIL` and `CF_API_KEY` need to be set for traefik in `docker-compose.yml`
3. `domain` and `email` need to be set in `traefik.toml`

## Deploy

```bash
# 1. pull latest public images
docker-compose pull

# 2. deploy containers with docker compose
docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans
```
