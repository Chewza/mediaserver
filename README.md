# Docker Plex & Usenet Media Server #

docker-based plex & usenet media server using custom subdomains with tls

## Motivation

- host each service as a subdomain of a personal domain over https
- run public maintained images with no modifications
- keep source repo small (2 required files)
- require minimal configuration and setup

## Features

- [Plex](https://hub.docker.com/r/plexinc/pms-docker) organizes video, music and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone Plex Media Server.
- [NZBGet](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/nzbget/) is a usenet downloader, written in C++ and designed with performance in mind to achieve maximum download speed by using very little system resources.
- [Sonarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/sonarr/) (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.
- [Radarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/radarr/) - A fork of Sonarr to work with movies Ã  la Couchpotato.
- [NZBHydra](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/hydra2/) 2 is a meta search application for NZB indexers, the "spiritual successor" to NZBmegasearcH, and an evolution of the original application NZBHydra . It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers.
- [Traefik](https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.

## Requirements

- dedicated server or PC with plenty of storage
- windows or linux x86/x64 os (not ARM)
- personal top-level domain with configurable sub-domains (eg. plex.mydomain.com)

## ACME & DNS

The following subdomains should point to the public IP of your server:

- `plex.mydomain.com`
- `nzbget.mydomain.com`
- `sonarr.mydomain.com`
- `radarr.mydomain.com`
- `hydra.mydomain.com`
- `traefik.mydomain.com`

## Installation

1. install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)

2. install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

3. clone mediaserver repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/klutchell/mediaserver.git
```

## Configuration

Copy `env.sample` to `.env` and fill all required fields

```bash
cp env.sample .env && nano .env
```

## Deployment

Pull and deploy containers with docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

## Extras

Optionally load all additional services by providing two compose files from the command line

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.extras.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.extras.yml up -d
```

Or just load a subset of the extra services (eg. nextcloud & mariadb only)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.extras.yml pull nextcloud mariadb
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.extras.yml up -d nextcloud mariadb
```

Manually create a nextcloud database & user

```bash
docker exec -it mariadb mysql -u root -p

mysql> CREATE DATABASE nextcloud;
mysql> CREATE USER 'nextcloud'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEXTCLOUD_DB_PASSWORD';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nextcloud.* TO 'nextcloud'@'%';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'nextcloud'@'%';
```

Manually create a codimd database & user

```bash
docker exec -it mariadb mysql -u root -p

mysql> CREATE DATABASE codimd;
mysql> CREATE USER 'codimd'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'CODIMD_DB_PASSWORD';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON codimd.* TO 'codimd'@'%';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'codimd'@'%';
```

Manually create a ghost database & user

```bash
docker exec -it mariadb mysql -u root -p

mysql> CREATE DATABASE ghost;
mysql> CREATE USER 'ghost'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'GHOST_DB_PASSWORD';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ghost.* TO 'ghost'@'%';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'ghost'@'%';
```
